2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code follows the existing code style
6. Issue that pull request!

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Windows 10/11
- Visual Studio 2022 or VS Code
- .NET 8.0 SDK
- Git

### Setting up your development environment

1. Clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/stash.git
   cd stash
   ```

2. Build the project:
   ```bash
   dotnet build synapse/synapse.csproj
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   dotnet run --project synapse/synapse.csproj
   ```

### Development Guidelines

#### Code Style

- Follow C# coding conventions
- Use meaningful variable and method names
- Keep methods small and focused
- Add XML documentation comments for public APIs
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations

#### MVVM Pattern

This project strictly follows the MVVM pattern:

- **ViewModels** must inherit from `ObservableObject`
- Use `[ObservableProperty]` for properties
- Use `[RelayCommand]` for commands
- Never reference Views from ViewModels
- Use data binding for all UI interactions

#### Database Changes

When modifying database models:

1. Make your changes to the model classes
2. Create a new migration:
   ```bash
   dotnet ef migrations add YourMigrationName --project synapse
   ```
3. Test the migration thoroughly
4. Include migration files in your PR

#### Testing

- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Ensure existing tests pass
- Test UI changes manually on Windows 10 and 11
- Test with different DPI settings

### Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

### Documentation

- Update the README.md if needed
- Update CLAUDE.md for AI-assisted development changes
- Add XML documentation comments for public APIs
- Include inline comments for complex logic
