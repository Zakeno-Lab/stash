# Test Code Samples for Clipboard

## C# Sample
```csharp
public class HelloWorld
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

## Python Sample
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

print(fibonacci(10))
```

## JavaScript Sample
```javascript
const greet = (name) => {
    console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
};

greet("Synapse");
```

## SQL Sample
```sql
SELECT u.name, COUNT(o.id) as order_count
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id
WHERE u.created_at > '2024-01-01'
GROUP BY u.name
ORDER BY order_count DESC;
```

## Simple Code Detection Test
Copy these individually to test detection:

1. Simple function:
function calculateSum(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}

2. Class definition:
public class User {
    private string name;
    private int age;
}

3. Regular text (should NOT be detected as code):
This is just regular text without any code patterns.

4. URL (should be detected as URL, not code):
https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code

5. Mixed content with some code keywords:
The user created a new function to handle the request.
